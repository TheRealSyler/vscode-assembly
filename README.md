My version of [13xforever/x86_64-assembly-vscode](https://github.com/13xforever/x86_64-assembly-vscode), i have modified the grammar to look better for the default vscode theme, and i probably added autocompletion and other stuff, i wrote this before starting to work on the code for extension, which is why im not sure what this extension does, i probably won't edit this again anytime soon.
